# self_driving
Self-driving tools like 'Lane Detection' and 'Traffic Signs Classification' using OpenCV, Deep Neural Nets and Convolution Neural Nets. 


1. Lane detection: Uses OpenCV to detect lane in a video. 
2. Classifies two sets of linearly seperable data using logistic regression with Keras. 
3. Classifies non-lieanarly seperable data using keras based Deep Neural Netwotk Models. 
4. Classifying Multi-class datasets (where data can be devided into more that two catagories) using.
5. MNIST dataset classification using keras based Deep Neural Network. (Not CNN).
6. MNIST dataset classification using keras based Convolution Neural Network.
7. Classifying 49 classes of traffic signs using keras based Convolution Neural Network.
