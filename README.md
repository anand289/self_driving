# self_driving
Basic self-driving tools like 'Lane Detection' and 'Traffic Signs Classification' using OpenCV, Deep Neural Nets and Convolution Neural Nets. 


1. Lane detection: Uses OpenCV to detect lane in a video. 
2. Classifies two sets of linearly seperable data using logistic regression with Keras. 
3. Classifies non-lieanarly seperable data using keras based Deep Nueral Netwotk Models. 
4. Classifying Multi-class datasets (where data can be devided into more that two catagories) using
